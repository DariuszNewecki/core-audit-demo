"""Sample module that deliberately violates the starter constitution.

The CORE audit should flag four things here:
  - greet() has no `# ID:` anchor          -> starter.symbol_ids   (BLOCKING)
  - greet() has no docstring               -> starter.docstrings   (reporting)
  - greet() uses print()                   -> starter.no_print     (reporting)
  - greet() swallows an exception silently -> starter.no_bare_except(reporting)

Remove the violations (add a `# ID:` anchor + docstring, swap print for a
logger, name the exception) and the audit goes green.
